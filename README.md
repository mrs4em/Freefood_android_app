Freefood_android_app
====================

Here is the basic code for the android app. Currently it just interacts with a database I have hosted on my computer.

I have also uploaded the php scripts that I used. As discussed in the meeting, these are VERY unprotected, and need major changes. Feel free to edit them and push them back onto github. (I will be making changes too, but I think these files could be good practice for us to collaborativly use github!)
